## 🔍 Detailed Analysis of Recent Events

### 1. The "410 Gone" Issue (RESOLVED)
When the agent started, it attempted to scan historical failures in your repository. GitHub's retention policy for logs is typically 90 days. For many of your older runs (ID starting with `18...`), the log files have expired and been deleted by GitHub servers.
*   **Previous Behavior:** The agent would crash or log "Critical Error" repeatedly when encountering these.
*   **Current Behavior:** The agent now detects the `410 Gone` status, marks the record as `FAILED` (meaning logs are unavailable), and moves on. This prevents the agent from getting stuck in an infinite retry loop.

### 2. Implementation of System Memory
I have successfully implemented a "Persistence Layer" for these failures. 
*   **How it works:** Once a failure is marked with a "FAILED" status because logs are missing, the agent stores this in `ci_cd_monitor.db`. 
*   **The Result:** On the next polling cycle, the agent sees these IDs in the database and skips them instantly. This significantly reduces API overhead and keeps your logs clean.

### 3. Pipeline Connectivity
The Monitor and the Agent are now fully "handshaking." 
*   Failures detected by the `Monitor` are now immediately passed to the `Agent` orchestrator via a callback mechanism.
*   The Agent filters out logless failures before they even reach the AI (GPT-4o) stage, saving you token costs.

## 🛠️ Current Status & Verification
The system is currently **healthy and stable**. It has finished cleaning up the "backlog" of old failures.

To see the system process a *new* failure:
1.  Push a commit to `vediyappanm/UltraThinking-LLM-Training` that you expect to fail.
2.  The agent will detect it within 5 minutes.
3.  Since the logs will be fresh, it will bypass the "Expired" check and send the failure to GPT-4o for analysis.

## 📁 Files Updated
- `src/github_client.py`: Added 410 error suppression.
- `src/monitor.py`: Added callback support and expired log handling.
- `src/agent.py`: Integrated callback and analysis filtering logic.
